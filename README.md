# Angularjs-Helper package

After developing AngularJS applications for a few months I find myself writing the same code over and over and if it is true is not difficult it is very time consuming an error prone. So I decided to collect the most common practices based on the way I developed these applications and put into generators and snippets so I could concentrate in what really matters and stop worrying about a lot repetitive boilerplate code across my controllers, factories, views, etc.

I am by no means an angular expert and I am learning everyday so hopefully what I have included in this package are reasonable practices that other people could use too and if some body wants to contribute to this project is more than welcome.

More is coming soon ....
